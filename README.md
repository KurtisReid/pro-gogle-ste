Code used in my technical resume website I made in google sites

I origionally coded a website using foundation (the code for that can be found in the professional website repository), which allowed both html and css, but as i do not have a server ready at the moment, I partially put the code on a google  website. I then had to modify it to work with google sites, resulting in no use of css. 

The attached html files include the code, as well as some modifications from the google site.
  - containes no header or footer
  
Notes From webpage that were not included due to comment tags use not allowed on google sites:
<!--
       
        <!-- this web pages content was both precoded and recoded for cleanliness by Kurtis Reid -->
        <!-- this code originated from an earlier website I had coded, so there may be some redundant code -->
        <!-- this is the top half of the web-page as the webpage body is divided into 5 sections.
            1.) top
            2.) left column
            3.) center column
            4.) right column
            5.) bottom
        -->
 due to the use of google sites:
    - this layout may not be organized in the same appearance as the actual website, particularly the pictures
    - no css was coded by me

The code for this website is attached.
